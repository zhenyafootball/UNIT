<h2 class="target">Biography</h2>
<p>
    Andriy Kuzmenko was born on 17 August 1968, in Sambir, Lviv region.
    His family moved to the city of Novoyavorivsk, where he would start his career. As a child, he dreamed of becoming a
    garbage truck driver.
    His mother was a music teacher, while his father was an engineer.
    Kuzmenko, an only child, graduated from music school and from the Faculty of Dentistry.
    He was not interested in dentistry, but finished his studies at the request of the parents.
    He was also actively involved in sports and participated in biathlons.[citation needed] On 14 September 1997,
    Kuzmenko and his wife Svitlana had a daughter,
    who was given the name Maria Barbara, in honor of the Polish actress Barbara Brylska, a childhood idol of Kuzmenko.
    According to him, his wife resembles Brylska.

        2000s
        Kuzmenko's life heavily revolved around Skryabin during this period. In 2000, he became a presenter of his own
        hit parade "Hot Seven", which lasted until 2002.
        Beginning around 2003, Kuzmenko worked as a presenter of the programs "Chance" and "Shikanemo" with singer
        Natalia Mogilevska.
        He was given all control of management over Skryabin, and began to take the band in a sonically new direction.
        In 2006, Kuzmenko published his autobiography, titled "Me, Pobeda and Berlin". The book was wildly popular, and
        has been reprinted several times since then.
        In 2009, he created the group Payushchie Trusy (Singing Pants), and helped the project "DZIDZIO" grow in
        popularity.
        In the same year he was a voting member for the "Book of the Year B-B-C" award.

       2010s
           At the end of January 2014, Kuzmenko recorded a song dedicated to the events of Euromaidan, stating that he
           supports the people on the Maidan, but not the opposition. During the 2014 war,
           he helped the military and was wounded in the area of ATO in eastern Ukraine.
           In October 2014, he launched his own Internet radio station called «S.R.A.K.A.», which, according to him,
           played the music he listened to in the car.
           Shortly before his death, Kuzmenko strongly criticized the current government in interviews, wishing death
           upon government officials and accusing them of corruption.
